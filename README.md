# Mosaic-Picture
A program to create mosaic picture.

This is clearly not optimize. As database image, I have used kagglecatsanddogs. Can't upload it here (too big)

To use it, make sure to have python (not pIt will need a lot a resssources (mostly RAM).   
ython3 yet) and pip install image. Also, make sure the folder "base_dimage" is in the root directory of Mosaique_100.py (so unzip it) and don't rename it!  

command to use it: python Mosaique_100.py Path/to/the/wanted/image.jpg
